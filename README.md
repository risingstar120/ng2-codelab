# Codelab
This is an codelab platform designed to simplify creating interactive exercises.

Demo:

## Starting the server
This is a temporary hack to allow synchronous loading of the exercises.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Editing exercises
If you change an exercise run `npm run prefetch-exercises` to get the values reflected in the UI.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Angular-cli
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.22-1.
To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
